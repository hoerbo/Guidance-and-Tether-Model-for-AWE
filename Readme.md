# Guidance and Tether Model for Airborne Wind Energy

This repository contains a MATLAB/Simulink Guidance Model for autonomous flight on a lemniscate.
In addition, a Tether Model based on Kelvin-Voigt material is provided.
The functionality is demonstrated in a basic kinematic framework.
Further testing in a SiL Simulator (results shown below, but code not provided here) proofs robustness of the approach.

* **Onboard-Generation System**: flight on constant orbit, tether force set point tracking (1 kN)
* **Ground-Generation System**: flight on increasing orbit (tether reeling out), tether force set point tracking (1 kN) 
* Tether States: epsilon=tether strain, F=tether force
* clickable external links (youtube)

## Demo of Operation in SiL-Simulator

* **Untethered Flight on Constant Orbit**
* fully-fledged SiL-Simulator maintained by Institute of Flight Mechanics and Control, University of Stuttgart
* model: Bormatec Maja UAV Drone (wingspan: 2.2 m, mass ~4 kg)
* linear MIMO Low-Level Flight Control System
* video playback speed is doubled
* clickable external link (youtube)

## Features

#### Guidance
* general-purpose Guidance Model for flexible (kites) and rigid aircraft 
* suitable for onboard-generation and ground-generation systems
* input: lemniscate of bernoulli (target track)
* output: course angle/course rate and path angle/path rate in earth-fixed system

#### Tether Model
* formulated as system of implicit differential equations
* point masses connected with segments based on spring/damper models
* incorporates elasticity and drag effects

#### Kinematic Framework and Winch Model
* elementary simulation of aircraft movement
* allows basic demonstration of functionality of Guidance and Tether Model
* plain winch model for tether force tracking

## Usage
* main parameters are adjustable in settings.m
* run simulink_model
* current folder has to be the root directory (Simulink looks for extrinsic function tether_model.m)
* /moviemaker/create_movie.m allows generation of video files (as shown above) based on simulation output
